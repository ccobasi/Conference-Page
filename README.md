# CWS Development Bootcamp



> This project is my HTML & CSS Capstone Project in Microverse.

The project is a complete design on the CWS Development Bootcamp (Fictional). A design prototype from Cindy Shin [CC Global Summit 2015](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).

Complete design of the index, about and ticket page designed using Grid, Flexbox, and Position alongside with other CSS concepts.

In this project, CSS styling and bootstrap 4 was used.

I have to follow the challenge breakdown through, without skipping any step.

I used the CSS checkbox trick to implement the mobile menu.
